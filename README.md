# UDC
The Universal Data Cube (udc) library is for modeling data sets
as data cubes and integrating them together for visualization. The main points of interest are:

 * [Unit Tests](tests/udcTests.js)
 * [Annotated Source Code](docs/udc.html)

See also:

 * [udc-data](https://github.com/curran/udc-data) Data sets imported into the UDC framework.
 * countriesScatter - [run it](http://curran.github.io/examples/countriesScatter/v1/), [source](https://github.com/curran/examples/tree/gh-pages/countriesScatter/v1) - An example visualization that integrates two data sets and visualizes the combined result as a scatter plot.
